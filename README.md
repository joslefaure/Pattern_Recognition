My pattern recognition projects

This directory contains implementation of various pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms and experiments with a wide range of datasets including but not limited to iris dataset, wine dataset, haberman dataset, sonar dataset, blood_transfusion dataset.

The algorithms implemented are:

- Perceptron algorithm
- Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD)
- Naive Bayes
- PCA
- Bayesian Classifier
- Maximum likelihood function
- K-means (Soft and Hard) + ARI
